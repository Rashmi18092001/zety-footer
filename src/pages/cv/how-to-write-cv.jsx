                    <p>A <i>CV</i>, short for Curriculum Vitae, is a document summarizing your education, work experience, skills, achievements, and other qualifications. In the US, Canada, and Australia, a CV is used to apply for academic positions, while in other countries—it's the name of the document used to apply for a job.</p>
                    <p>Remember: </p>
                    <ul className="format">
                    <li>If you're applying outside of US, Canada or Australia, you should create a CV. But if you're trying to get a job in the US, you need to <span className="blue">make a resume</span>.</li>
                    <li>If you're making a CV for academic purposes in the US, Canada, or Australia, read our guide on the <span className="blue">differences between a CV and a resume</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And no, a CV is not a cover letter. A curriculum vitae contains your work history, education, and skills, while a cover letter explains the recruiter in detail why you’re the best match for the job. These documents are completely different, and you can learn more about those differences in this guide on <span className="blue">Curriculum Vitae vs. cover letter</span>.</p>

A resume is a one- to two-page document showing the most relevant info about your professional experience, educational background, and skills.

                    <p>In the US, a CV is a document used to apply for a position in academia, and that's why it focuses mainly on your educational background, while a resume highlights your work experience. A CV includes a complete list of publications, conferences, etc., so it’s often longer than a resume.</p>

                    <p>Here’s how to make a job-winning CV work experience section:</p>
                    <ol className="struct">
                        <li>Focus on your measurable, relevant achievements, not just your duties.</li>
                        <li>Use <span className="blue">action verbs</span>: “created,” “analyzed,” and “implemented,” not “responsible for creating, analysis, and implementation.”</li>
                        <li><span className="blue">Tailor your CV </span>to the job posting—read the job description carefully and check what tasks will be expected of you. If you’ve done them before—put them on your CV, even if those weren’t your primary responsibilities.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The contact information section seems pretty straightforward, but here’s one reason it might be tricky:</p>
                    <p>Recruiters will use it to research you online. If your social media profiles are unprofessional or your <span className="blue"> LinkedIn profile </span>information doesn’t match your CV, you’re immediately out of the race.</p>

                    <p>Good news is, <span className="blue">creating a CV education </span> sectionis usually simple.</p>
                    <p>If you’ve got any post-secondary education, include only that on your CV. Don’t mention your high school unless it’s your highest education degree. List:</p>
                    <ul className="struct">
                        <li>Graduation year (if you’re still studying, enter your <span className="blue">expected graduation date</span>)</li>
